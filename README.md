# Weekly Code Challenge

I've always wanted to improve my current coding skills but felt lost in where to start. There's so much to learn that it can be overwhelming to decide what exactly you want to improve.

So I decided to start a weekly coding challenge by choosing a design from Dribbble that is attainable to develop and challenge me at the same time.
Once a week I will dedicate at least 45 min of my time outside of work to work on this challenge. 

This task will take determination and commitment to polish and improve my coding skills, mainly in Javascript. I will take note of the UX and fluid designs to create that visual experience. 

### Main Goal

```
Build a fluid user experience each week focusing on Javascript and the design provided.
```

## Building Specs
